          My name is Lathe and I'm accused of being a software developer. I
          graduated from a coding bootcamp in 2021 called Base Camp Coding
          Academy and it's been quite the journey ever since.

      <h2>What is Base Camp Coding Academy?</h2>
      <p>Per their website:</p>
      <p>
        Base Camp Coding Academy (BCCA) is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization
        with the intention to create a pipeline for under-advantaged individuals
        in Mississippi to access careers in software development by offering an
        immersive, hands-on, and fast-paced program designed to transform
        passionate individuals into job-ready software engineers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Base Camp is not only consistent of the career technical path of the Coding Technology degree
        from Northwest Mississippi Community College, but has a myriad of sponsors
        such as Renasant Bank, Core Logic (now Cotality), and CSpire.
        You can see their whole list of sponsors <a href="https://basecampcodingacademy.org/sponsors/">here</a></p>
    <p>
        Below is a summary of the last few years of my career with links to some of the stuff I've worked on.
        I'm working on making them publicly usable so some may just be a link to Github.
    </p>
    <p>Enjoy!</p>

        <p>
          Initially I started my journey with Python, and <a href="https://github.com/BaseCampCoding/fundamentals-of-programming-pt-1-unit-project-matthew-and-lathe">my first unit project</a>
          was with a developer named Matthew who was a much better programmer (Who quite frankly did most of the work). This
          taught me a lot how being surrounded by talent can bring out the
          talent in others.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the next project was with someone much more my speed.
          Although it was humbling, I learned more and more of the fundamentals
          of Python and programming.

          During the spring of 2020, I was able to test my newly aquired Django
          skills to make <a href="https://github.com/LatheWard/CourseTrack">a small project for my internship at Renasant Bank
          called CourseTrack.</a> This would be my first time being involved in a

          After graduating from Base Camp, the investment of learning COBOL +
          the AS400 paid off, and for 2 years I would work on a lean team
          resolving session issues, writing new account ledger programs in RPG
          IV, and making solid waste management programs in COBOL.

          After 2 years of this, I decided I wanted to go back to web
          development and build on to the skills I gained in school. To my
          suprise, a very cool cyber security company needed a Full Stack dev.
          My current employer, Circadence, has taught me so much about
          Typescript, React, Python, and best practices within the web
          development space and the cyber security space.
