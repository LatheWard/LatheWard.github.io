        <p>
          My name is Lathe and I'm accused of being a software developer. I
          graduated from a coding bootcamp in 2021 called Base Camp Coding
          Academy and it's been quite the journey ever since. I've had the
          pleasure of working across the spectrum of projects from COBOL to
          React, and this is a short portfolio I put together to summarize my career
          up to today.

      <h2>What is Base Camp Coding Academy?</h2>
      <p>Per their website:</p>
      <p>
        Base Camp Coding Academy (BCCA) is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization
        with the intention to create a pipeline for under-advantaged individuals
        in Mississippi to access careers in software development by offering an
        immersive, hands-on, and fast-paced program designed to transform
        passionate individuals into job-ready software engineers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Base Camp is not only consistent of the career technical path of the
        Coding Technology degree from Northwest Mississippi Community College,
        but has a myriad of sponsors such as Renasant Bank, Core Logic (now
        Cotality), and CSpire. You can see their whole list of sponsors
        <a href="https://basecampcodingacademy.org/sponsors/">here</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Below are the highlights with links to some of the stuff I've worked on.
        I'm working on making them publicly usable so some may just be a link to
        Github.

      <p>Enjoy!</p>

          Initially I started my journey with Python, and

            >my first unit project</a
          >
          was with a developer named Matthew who was a much more experienced
          programmer. This taught me a lot how being surrounded by talent can
          bring out the talent in others.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the next project was with someone much more my speed.
          Although it was humbling, I learned more and more of the fundamentals
          of Python and programming.

          During the spring of 2020, I was able to test my newly aquired Django

          This would be my first time being involved in a teams meeting,
          creating a platform from top to bottom, and seeing how a team within
          an organization works.

          During my time at BCCA, I grew an interest in legacy systems because I
          noticed that there wasn't a huge focus in the industry for this
          codebase that runs some of the most critical systems in the US. After
          graduating from Base Camp, the investment of learning COBOL + the
          AS400 paid off, and for 2 years I would work on a lean team resolving
          session issues, writing new account ledger programs in RPG IV, and
          making solid waste management programs in COBOL for North
          Mississippi's largest development district, Three Rivers.

          I eventually decided I wanted to go back to web development and build
          on to the skills I gained in school. To my suprise, a very cool cyber
          security company needed a Full Stack dev. My current employer,
          Circadence, has taught me so much about Typescript, React, Python, and
          best practices within the web development space and the cyber security
          space.
